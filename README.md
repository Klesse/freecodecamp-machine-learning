[Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a online platform that offers free learning content about different areas of technology, 
such as data science, linux, web development, database query and more.

## About the course

This course teachs different approachs of machine learning (such as NLP, clustering, linear regression) as introduces 
to deep learning.

Some skills learned throughout the course:

1. Basic text manipulation and NLP.
2. Linear regression machine learning model.
3. Clustering algorithms (k-means, KNN).
4. RNNs.
5. CNNs and basic of deep learning in computer vision.
6. Hidden Markov models.
7. Basics of Q-learning.
8. Python libraries such as pandas, sklearn and tensorflow.

The course offers when you finish it a certification, but to get it the student has to make five projets.

## Projects

### 1. Rock Paper Scissors

Introduction to ML with an app that the user has to develop strategies to gain against four players in rock paper scissors game.

In **rock-paper-scissors**.

### 2. Cat and Dog Image Classifier

This project consists in creating a CNN to classify images as a dog or a cat. The project had a requirement of a minimum accuracy of 63%.

In **fcc_cat_dog.ipynb**.

### 3. Book Recommendation Engine using KNN

Approach to recommend five books from a given one. KNN calculates the distance of the input book to the other in the dataset to recommend five others.

In **fcc_book_recommendation_knn.ipynb**.

### 4. Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator

Predicting a person's health cost base in his attributes. This projects uses a machine learning linear regression model.

In **fcc_predict_health_costs_with_regression.ipynb**.

### 5. Neural Network SMS Text Classifier

This project consists in classifying text as spam or not spam using a neural network approach.

In **fcc_sms_text_classification.ipynb**.
